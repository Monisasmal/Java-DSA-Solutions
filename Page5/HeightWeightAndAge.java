// Once upon a time, there was a program that took three integers (height, weight, and age) as input from a person. The program performed different operations based on the values of height, weight, and age.

// If height was equal to 5, weight was equal to 50, and age was equal to 10, the program printed Overweight.

// If height was equal to 5 or weight was equal to 60, the program printed Fat.

// If height was equal to 6 and weight was equal to 50, the program printed Slim.

// If none of these conditions were met, the program simply printed None.

// Would you like to write a program that performs these operations using your programming skills?
